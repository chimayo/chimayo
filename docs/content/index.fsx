Chimayo.Ssis
======================

Chimayo is a library for creating and manipulating SQL Server Integration Services packages with F# code.
    
Chimayo provides a completely different development experience for producing SSIS packages that fits with modern software development:
    
* Write code, not a custom DSL, and benefit from refactoring, compile-time testing, test automation and reuse
* Generate SSIS packages that work well in version control systems, such as Git, or just keep the F# code and generate them on demand
* Benefit from functional programming with pattern matching, immutable data structures and strong typing
    
Chimayo is not object-oriented software and is designed to be consumed directly from F#.
    
Chimayo also provides a command line tool that can be used to convert between supported SSIS formats.

I welcome community involvement, it's the main reason for putting this code in the public domain. However, before
opening to new features and enhancements, my focus is to put the supporting materials in place, such as this
website, documentation, examples and regression tests.

There is an [API Reference](reference/index.html) for those ready to dive in.
