Chimayo.Ssis
======================

Chimayo is a library for creating and manipulating SQL Server Integration Services packages with F# code.
    
Chimayo provides a completely different development experience for producing SSIS packages that fits with modern software development:
    
* Write code, not a custom DSL, and benefit from refactoring, compile-time testing, test automation and reuse
* Generate SSIS packages that work well in version control systems, such as Git, or just keep the F# code and generate them on demand
* Benefit from functional programming with pattern matching, immutable data structures and strong typing
    
Chimayo is not object-oriented software and is designed to be consumed directly from F#.
    
Chimayo also provides a command line tool that can be used to convert between supported SSIS formats.
