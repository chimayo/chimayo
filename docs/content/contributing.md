The Chimayo source code is on [GitHub][gh] and [issues][issues] are also tracked there.

I welcome community involvement, it's the main reason for putting this code in the public domain. However, before
opening to new features and enhancements, my focus is to put the supporting materials in place, such as this
website, documentation, examples and regression tests.
